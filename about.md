My name is David Delabass√©e, I'm a DevRel in Oracle's Java Platform Group. In fact, I have been working in the Java ecosystem since the early days of this technology. 

Before joining the Java Platform Group, I was working in Oracle's Serverless Group where I was mostly focused on the open source [Fn Project](https://github.com/fnproject) (and I still enjoy that project!).

Prior to that, I was working as a Software Evangelist in the Oracle Java EE organization and was heavily involved in the initiative to transition the developemnt of the Java EE platform to the Eclipse Foundation, aka [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/).

I am a regular speaker at [conferences and user groups, large and small, local and global](http://delabassee.com/conferences/).

I am co-hosting with Chad Arimura the [Inside Java Podcast](https://inside.java/podcast).

I can be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delabassee) (DMs are open).

You can find a more formal, third person bio [here](/bio).
